    "### 6. Conclusion\n",
    "The goal of this project was to investigate the correlation between the number of trees planted and the speed limits on roads in Berlin. Contrary to the initial expectation, the data does not show a negative correlation. Instead, the correlation is slightly positive, ranging between 0 and 0.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "A plausible explanation for this unexpected outcome is that longer roads, which tend to have higher speed limits, also accumulate more trees due to their length. Some of these longer roads, specifically Bundesautobahnen and Bundesstraßen, can be considered as outliers and have been filtered. Despite filtering them out, the impact of the remaining ones seems significant enough to influence the correlation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This conclusion underlines the importance of careful data processing and the influence of outliers on the results of a statistical analysis. \n",
    "The findings also emphasize the complexities involved in making accurate predictions and the potential for unexpected results even when reasoning about the data seems sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outlook\n",
    "Future work could involve refining the data cleaning process to address the influence of longer roads. For instance, streets could be filtered based on length, or the number of trees could be standardized by street length to adjust for the size of different roads. Another approach could be to eliminate streets with speed limits above a certain threshold, like 50 km/h, to focus on inter city streets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it could be beneficial to explore the correlation with other factors, such as traffic volume, road width, or the proximity of parks and green areas. The role of urban planning policies could also be an interesting aspect to consider, as they may influence both the placement of trees and the establishment of speed limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, while the project's results deviated from my initial hypothesis, it provided valuable insights into the nature of data analysis. It underscored the importance of careful data preprocessing, the handling of outliers, and the challenges in making accurate predictions. These lessons can be instrumental in future data analysis projects, both in the context of advanced methods of software engineering and beyond."
